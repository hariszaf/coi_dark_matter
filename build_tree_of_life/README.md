Here you may find all the consensus sequences for each domain of life, along with the pre-process needed to merge them. 

The `iq_tree_job.sh` is the script we ran to build the complete phylogenetic tree. 

In the `domain_trees` directory, you may find three more phylogenetic trees, one for each of the domains of life, using the correspoding consensus sequences.
